# BakingTutorial
The task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacity resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.


BakingApp
The Baking App displays a list of recipes, ingredients required to make it, and steps plus video tutorials on how to make the recipe.

This is a rewrite of the Baking App project from the Udacity Android Nanodegree Programme
